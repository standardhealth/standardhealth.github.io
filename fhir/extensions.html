The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.</p>

The StatementContext class aligns with the SNOMED CT Situations with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model. The StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information. It also often holds provenance information relevant to the context of the clinical statement. It is important to note that by default the context applies to the conjunction of the attribute specified in the statement. For instance, if a clinical statement has a topic describing a rash on left arm and a context of ‘absent’, then the statement states that the subject of interest did not have a rash on the left arm but might have had one on the right arm.</p>

<td>An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation.

The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual.</td>

<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationQualifier"><code>ObservationQualifier</code></a></td>
<td>0 or more</td>
<td>A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#DataAbsentReason"><code>DataAbsentReason</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>Provides a reason why the value of the observation is missing, if it is expected (some observations are not expected to have a value).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ClinicallyRelevantTime"><code>ClinicallyRelevantTime</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>The time or time period that the observation addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium).</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ReferenceRange"><code>ReferenceRange</code></a></td>
<td>0 or more</td>
<td>The usual or acceptable range for a test result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../lab/index.html#Interpretation"><code>Interpretation</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>A clinical interpretation of a measurement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../core/index.html#Comment"><code>Comment</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>A critical or explanatory note written to discuss, support, explain changes to, or dispute information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#PanelMembers"><code>PanelMembers</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>PanelMembers represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author.</td>

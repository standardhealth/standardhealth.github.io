<h3><a name="ProviderRelationship"></a>ProviderRelationship [Entry]</h3>
<p>A person or organization responsible for providing a service to the person of record. Such a relationship can exist without a specific encounter or services being rendered; for example, an emergency contact relationship can exist without ever calling upon that person. The entry can also be used to state that a provider relationship does not exist, e.g., patient does not have a primary care provider. <a href="http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov/C1314939">C1314939</a></p>

<td>When true, indicates either that the event or action documented in the entry did not occur. For example, if immunization is not given, the NonOccurrenceModifier=true will indicate this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When applied to a recommendation, the modifier indicates the action mentioned in the topic should not take place. For example, a request to NOT elevate the head of a bed using the code for elevating the bed, and setting ProhibitedModifier to true. Other examples include do not ambulate, do not flush NG tube, do not take blood pressure on a certain arm, etc. If the SpecificType contains negation and ProhibitedModifier is true, that will reinforce the prohibition, and should not be interpreted as a double negative that equals a positive.</td>

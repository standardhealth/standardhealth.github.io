<td>An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An Observation contains information about the act of observing or measuring, and the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual.</td>

For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH).

For example, for a Condition, the concept is MTH#C0348080 (Condition) but the Value is the SpecificType, i.e. MTH#C0011849 (Diabetes Mellitus). For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH). In other cases, the SpecificType is the specific question being asked, or the specific goal being pursued.</td>

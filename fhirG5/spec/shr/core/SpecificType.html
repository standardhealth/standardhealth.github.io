<h3><a name="SpecificType"></a>SpecificType</h3>
<p>A code or description representing the concept represented by the instance at a specific level. For example, for a Condition, the concept is MTH#C0348080 (Condition) but the Value is the SpecificType, i.e. MTH#C0011849 (Diabetes Mellitus). For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH). In other cases, the SpecificType is the specific question being asked, or the specific goal being pursued.</p>

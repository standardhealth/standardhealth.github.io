For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH). In other cases, the SpecificType is the specific question being asked, or the specific goal being pursued.</td>

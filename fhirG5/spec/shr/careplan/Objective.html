<h3><a name="Objective"></a>Objective</h3>
<p>Describes the  of an expected or desired achievement that is well-defined, specific, measurable, and derived from one or more goals. There are similarities with Observation, since an objective can sometimes be interpreted as a yet-to-be-made, future observation with a certain target result.</p>

<tr>
<td>Based On: <a href="../base/index.html#Action"><code>Action</code></a></td>
<td></td>
<td>A deed or endeavor; an action taken to address a undesired health state, behavior, risk, or goal. An action can have various contexts: definitional, occurred/not occurred, ordered/not ordered, recommended/recommended against.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../core/index.html#SpecificType"><code>SpecificType</code></a></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A code or description representing the concept represented by the instance at a specific level. For example, for a Condition, the concept is MTH#C0348080 (Condition) but the Value is the SpecificType, i.e. MTH#C0011849 (Diabetes Mellitus). For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH). In other cases, the SpecificType is the specific question being asked, or the specific goal being pursued.</td>

<td>0 or more</td>
<td>A categorization of the action according its type, often a code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This can be used for searching, sorting and display purposes.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../base/index.html#NonOccurrenceModifier"><code>NonOccurrenceModifier</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>When true, indicates either that the event or action documented in the entry did not occur. For example, if immunization is not given, the NonOccurrenceModifier=true will indicate this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When applied to a recommendation, the modifier indicates the action mentioned in the topic should not take place. For example, a request to NOT elevate the head of a bed using the code for elevating the bed, and setting ProhibitedModifier to true. Other examples include do not ambulate, do not flush NG tube, do not take blood pressure on a certain arm, etc. If the SpecificType contains negation and ProhibitedModifier is true, that will reinforce the prohibition, and should not be interpreted as a double negative that equals a positive.</td>

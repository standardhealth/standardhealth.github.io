Condition can be used to track a problem or a risk over a period of time. By virtue of its continuity over time, Condition is different from an Observation or Assessment; Observations represents evidence, and an Assessment is a judgment based on evidence and rendered at a point in time. Diagnosis is a type of Assessment that can lead to creation of a Condition (as can an assessment of risk). The two relate because observations can lead to conclusion that a Condition exists. A statement that a certain condition does not exist should be an assessment. Not all conditions are problems, but all problems are (in some sense) conditions.</td>

<h3><a name="Progression"></a>Progression [Entry]</h3>
<p>A finding related to the current trend of a disease.

For example, for a Condition, the concept is MTH#C0348080 (Condition) but the Value is the SpecificType, i.e. MTH#C0011849 (Diabetes Mellitus). For an observation, the SpecificType defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The SpecificType should always align with the concept of the element, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure, and may be from a different code system (e.g. LOINC versus MTH). In other cases, the SpecificType is the specific question being asked, or the specific goal being pursued.</td>

<td>An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An Observation contains information about the act of observing or measuring, and the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual.</td>

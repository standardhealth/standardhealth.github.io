<td>An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An Observation contains information about the act of observing or measuring, and the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual.</td>

<td>1</td>
<td>A representation of a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, risk, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble. Condition can be used to track a problem or a risk over a period of time. By virtue of its continuity over time, Condition is different from an Observation or Assessment; Observations represents evidence, and an Assessment is a judgment based on evidence and rendered at a point in time. Diagnosis is a type of Assessment that can lead to creation of a Condition (as can an assessment of risk). The two relate because observations can lead to conclusion that a Condition exists. A statement that a certain condition does not exist should be an assessment. Not all conditions are problems, but all problems are (in some sense) conditions.</td>

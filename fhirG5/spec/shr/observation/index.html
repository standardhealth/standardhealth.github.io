<p>A simplified observation consisting of a type code, value (or data absent reason), reference range, and interpretation. Can be used in place of an observation when a full observation cannot be mapped, for example, in the components of an observation. Note that although Status is required, the value is not mapped to FHIR and is essentially ignored.</p>

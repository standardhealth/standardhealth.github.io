<h3><a name="PanelMembers"></a>PanelMembers</h3>
<p>PanelMembers represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author.</p>

<td>An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An Observation contains information about the act of observing or measuring, and the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual.</td>

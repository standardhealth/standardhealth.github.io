      p: "Widespread SHR implementation will result in interoperability across care settings as individuals and providers gain digital access to their SHR.  Key benefits of clinical interoperability include improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, minimization of waste, fraud, and abuse, and decreased costs that accompany healthier lives, improving healthcare access, quality, and uniformity. SHR provides the foundation for collection, communication, and aggregation of patient data, accelerating secondary uses in public health, disease surveillance, post-approval monitoring, and patient-centered outcomes research."
